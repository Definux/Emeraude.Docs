# Introduction

Emeraude is a web framework built on ASP.NET Core. The main purpose of the framework 
is to provide easy and consistent development process on the top of stable architecture. 
By following a large amount of design patterns Emeraude has high level of customization which 
gives to developers the opportunity to use the framework for many areas of application.

## What is Emeraude

Emeraude is a set of C# libraries developed to rise ASP.NET Core application to a new level. 
The framework wrap the application with clean architecture basis with built-in ready to use 
features and abstractions.

The main power of the framework is the ready to use administration panel integrated into the 
library. In addition to built-in modules each developer can easily create project specific 
admin features.

On the of client zone of the framework is developed the opportunity to be used classic Razor 
views and/or Vue based single page application (SPA) or server-side rendering (SSR) views. Of 
course the front-end is not locked for other visualization frameworks (Angular, React, etc) but with the ones in the 
previous sentence Emeraude can offer you a lot of productivity features.

## Technologies

Emeraude use a large set of technologies which are separated on three main sections. Each one 
is important for the core of the project.  

#### Back-end
- .NET Core 3.1
- ASP.NET Core
- Node.js

#### Data storage
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQLite
- JSON files

#### Front-end
- Razor
- Vue.js
- SASS
- Webpack
- Gulp

#### Mobile
- Xamarin forms

Of course almoust all technologies can be replaced with alternative ones but we suggest you to 
do this in case when Emeraude does not fit the requirements of your project.
