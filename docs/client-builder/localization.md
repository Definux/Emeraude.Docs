The localization module of the **Emeraude Client Builder** is the place where is made the connection 
between the administration UI and locales database.

The module is separated on three main parts:
- **Languages** - Define the languages which will be used from the system.
- **Translations** - Define the list of translation keys and their related translations in different languages.
- **Static Content** - Define static content for static/semi-static pages in different languages.
